<p>Installation on <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS 7</a> is very straight forward. First add the EPEL repository for <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS 7</a> as this is where you will find the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> rpm</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/beta/7/x86_64/epel-release-7-0.2.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>Install the required packages, <em>note npm is not required but handy to have around</em>.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install nodejs npm ruby ruby-devel rubygems git
gem install jekyll
</code></pre>

<p>Start using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/">HHVM</a> is a virtual machine for Hack and PHP it uses JIT to improve performance. Installation on a less than bleeding edge OS can prove a little challenging. What follows is what I did to get it up and going quickly for our developers in our CentOS 6.5 environment. It may work for you too.</p>

<p>Packages were sourced from two repo’s http://yum.gleez.com/ and http://remi.conetix.com.au/</p>

<p>Things boiled down to these 11 packages that were signed and added to our local yum repo:</p>

<pre><code>boost-filesystem-1.54.0-9.el6.x86_64.rpm
boost-program-options-1.54.0-9.el6.x86_64.rpm
boost-regex-1.54.0-9.el6.x86_64.rpm
boost-system-1.54.0-9.el6.x86_64.rpm
boost-thread-1.54.0-9.el6.x86_64.rpm
compat-mysql55-5.5.38-1.el6.remi.x86_64.rpm
hhvm-3.2.0-10.el6.x86_64.rpm
libbson-0.6.6-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
libstdc++48-4.8.2-10.el6.x86_64.rpm
libwebp-0.3.1-2.el6.remi.x86_64.rpm
tbb-4.1-2.20130116.el6.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>The only “<em>gotcha</em>” was the fact we have postfix installed and it was looking to use mysql-libs and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/">HHVM</a> wanted mysql55-libs to resolve some of it’s dependencies. This created some incompatibilities with postfix.</p>

<p>The issue was resolved using compat-mysql55, while there are a few places to find that rpm the only one contained libmysqlclient.so.18.0.0 version of the library that was needed was the <a href="http://remi.conetix.com.au/">Remi</a> site.</p>

<p>If you have mysql55-libs available in your repos then you will need to install the compact library first</p>

<pre><code>yum install compat-mysql55
yum install hhvm
</code></pre>

<p>If you don’t then you can go right ahead</p>

<pre><code>yum install hhvm
</code></pre>

<p>Oracle Linux 7 was <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/2245947">released this last week</a> 2nd of RHEL directives to make a GA release, <a href="http://seven.centos.org/2014/07/release-announcement-for-centos-7x86_64/">CentOS</a> being the first and <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a> still to come, currently in alpha.</p>

<p>No real surprises here, now comes with the UEK, <code>3.8.13-35.3.1.el7uek.x86_64</code>, kernel as default. If you what to test it out and take it for a spin it’s pretty easy to using the my <a href="https://github.com/bigal/lunchbox">lunchbox</a> set of <a href="http://www.packer.io/">packer</a> templates files which have been updated to support OEL 7.0.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Btrfs</li>
  <li>XFS</li>
  <li>Linux Containers (LXC)</li>
  <li>DTrace</li>
  <li>Ksplice for zero-downtime kernel security updates and bug fixes</li>
  <li>Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) Release 3</li>
  <li>systemd, a new service and system manager</li>
  <li>Grub2 as the default boot loader with support for additional firmware types, such as UEFI</li>
  <li>Support for in-place upgrades from OEL 6.5 to OEL 7</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to download the ISO via the <a href="https://edelivery.oracle.com/linux/">Oracle Edelivery site</a></p>]]></content><author><name>Alan Chalmers</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="blog" /><category term="Oracle" /><category term="Linux" /><category term="packer" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Life in the old blog</title><link href="http://www.resilvered.com/blog/2014/07/26/Life-in-the-old-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life in the old blog" /><published>2014-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://www.resilvered.com/blog/2014/07/26/Life-in-the-old-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.resilvered.com/blog/2014/07/26/Life-in-the-old-blog/"><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/assets/images/ScreenShot-theme-base-08.png" width="200" /></div>

<p>So the old blog got a face lift, and when you do that the thing everyone does is to write a blog aticle about it. Well me too but it will be pretty short and not very detailed as there are loads of places that can cover thats better than me.</p>

<p>First stop was to move to my own domain name, get over to <a href="https://hover.com/NW97rheW">hover</a> for that and setup <a href="http://www.resilvered.com">www.resilvered.com</a> to point to <a href="http://www.resilvered.com">resilvered.blogger.com</a> and have it server my new custom domain. Note I didn’t go for a .au domain becuase of price and the requirement of an ABN.</p>

<p>Like most folks the reason for the move is I find writting in blogger a PITA and as I spend most of my life in a text editor with scritping and the ocassional markdown language settling on using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> was as they say a no brainer.</p>

<p>So go and grab <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for your platform, a simple brew install on my Mac, and make sure you are using or have <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and get yourself a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account and sign up to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>All the kiddies are using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> these days so if you are like me and have used every other version control system but git then check out this <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">no BS git site</a> to get yourself going with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.</p>

<p>There are loads of template options avialble for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I settled on <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> and didn’t want to spend all my time looking around. After that I stole / got insperation from a number of other places below such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blog.davidebbo.com/">Davis Ebbo’s Blog</a></li>
  <li>Jekyll <a href="http://enrmarc.github.io/tags.html">Cloud Tags</a></li>
  <li>Alternate <a href="http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/">Cloud tags</a> that I did not use</li>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> template comes with some diffrent colour themes. Some screenshots from below let me know which colours look best.</p>

<p>Some times you just have to make do with what you have. So I considered this morning why is it as IT professional we are often told what tool we need to use to do our job. I mean does a carpenter get told what type of saw he need to use?</p>

<p>My tool of the trade is a Mac, not because I’m an Apple fan boy ,far from it, but as a functional computer it really does just work. Has access to the tools I need due to it’s Unix heritage, and provides and usable graphical interface for the less technical in the family.</p>

<p>It’s 2014 and it still astounds me that Windows can’t ship with a decent terminal/ command shell and ssh. Plenty of after mark products about but they really are just all flawed in subtlety different ways. My current engagement finds them doing their very best to make my life as hard as possible to achieve any real outcome. I have a bunch of work to do that needs to be repeated across a number of servers, knowing full well I have better chance of being the next flight to the space station than getting Puppet or Chef installed, I’ve opted for Ansible.</p>

<p>So if like myself you find yourself in a position to need to run some ansible from a Windows PC that you don;t have admin rights on then read on if not then arrivederci.</p>

<p>First up go grab yourself a copy of <a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">cygwin</a></p>

<p>So no admin rights on this box either open cmd and run <strong>setup-x86_64.exe –no-admin</strong> or create a shortcut on the Desktop and add the <strong>--no-admin</strong> option. Handy as you may need to run this again later for some other installation.</p>

<p>So when you get a chance you are going to need to install the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wget</li>
  <li>python</li>
  <li>python-crypto</li>
  <li>python-openssl</li>
  <li>python-setuptools</li>
  <li>git</li>
  <li>vim</li>
  <li>openssh</li>
  <li>openssl</li>
  <li>openssl-devel</li>
  <li>libsasl2</li>
  <li>ca-certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a bunch of dependent packages that are required the install should figure them out and you should accept them.</p>

<p>So pretty good chance you’ll be behind a proxy so when you open the cygwin terminal you might want to set this up.</p>

<pre><code>export http_proxy=http://user:passwd@my.corporate.proxy:80/
export https_proxy=https://user:passwd@my.corporate.proxy:80/
</code></pre>

<p>Probably drop them in your .bash_profile for later use.</p>

<p>Next you going to need PyYAML and Jinja2 for Ansible and these aren’t available in the <a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">cygwin</a> installer.</p>

<p>Grab PyYAML:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/P/PyYAML/PyYAML-3.10.tar.gz
tar -xvf PyYAML-3.10.tar.gz
cd PyYAML-3.10
python setup.py install
cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>Now grab Jinja2 and rinse repeat:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/J/Jinja2/Jinja2-2.6.tar.gz
tar -xvf Jinja2-2.6.tar.gz
cd Jinja2-2.6
python setup.py install
cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>If you don’t already have an ssh key the generate one. I would recommend setting a password and having a key agent installed also, ssh-keygen is what you are looking for</p>

<p>Behind the corporate firewall git will need a hand also.</p>

<pre><code>git config –global http.proxy $http_proxy
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can clone <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">ansible</a> from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible /opt/ansible
</code></pre>

<p>Setup some path stuff , you probably want to drop these in your .bash_profile also</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ANSIBLE=/opt/ansible
export PATH=$PATH:$ANSIBLE/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$ANSIBLE/lib
export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=$ANSIBLE/library
</code></pre>
<p>and your ready to rumble, or at least I though I was. Turns out there is an issue with the cygwin openssh and control master so make sure you add this line.</p>

<p>```sh
export ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS=”-o ControlMaster=no”</p>]]></content><author><name>Alan Chalmers</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="work" /><category term="windows" /><category term="ansible" /><category term="configuration management" /><category term="work" /><category term="windows" /><category term="ansible" /><category term="configuration management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some times you just have to make do with what you have.

I wouldn't call the TWiT shows super technical indeed there are more useful to get a sense of what is happening at the consumer end of the industry which drives a lot of what we do.<br /><br />I'm always on the look out for new and interesting stuff, so if you have any suggestions drop me a line<br /><h3>Recent Arrivals</h3><ul><li><a href="http://foodfightshow.org/">The Food Fight Show</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>Certainly has some handy tidbits and info especially if you are interested in whats going on in the DevOps space. They could do with some work on the audio quality but it's still early days for them.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://devopscafe.org/" target="_blank">DevOps Cafe Podcast&nbsp;</a></li></ul>Similar vane to the Food Fight Show , a little less Chef focused and again on occasion suffering in the audio quality department.<br /><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/cultcast/" target="_blank">CultCast</a></li></ul>The best Apple conversation all week long. That's their tag line, I have added this as a replacement for MacBreak Weekly as I can get the same news in a much smaller timeframe. It must be said that these guys reallly should avoid drinking and pod-casting there Cult Cast live from Mac World is absolutely to be avoided.<br /><h3>Old favorites&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><a href="http://twit.tv/floss" target="_blank">Floss Weekly&nbsp;</a></li></ul>Out of the TWiT Studios this is on my regular listen list, occasional item I skip over but good coverage of some general open source software.

I wouldn't call the TWiT shows super technical indeed there are more useful to get a sense of what is happening at the consumer end of the industry which drives a lot of what we do.I'm always on the look out for new and interesting stuff, so if you have any suggestions drop me a lineRecent ArrivalsThe Food Fight Show&nbsp;Certainly has some handy tidbits and info especially if you are interested in whats going on in the DevOps space. They could do with some work on the audio quality but it's still early days for them.DevOps Cafe Podcast&nbsp;Similar vane to the Food Fight Show , a little less Chef focused and again on occasion suffering in the audio quality department.CultCastThe best Apple conversation all week long. That's their tag line, I have added this as a replacement for MacBreak Weekly as I can get the same news in a much smaller timeframe. It must be said that these guys reallly should avoid drinking and pod-casting there Cult Cast live from Mac World is absolutely to be avoided.Old favorites&nbsp;Floss Weekly&nbsp;Out of the TWiT Studios this is on my regular listen list, occasional item I skip over but good coverage of some general open source software. I like the fact it's not Linux focused, some folks forget open source was about long before Linux.This Week in Google&nbsp;Another TWiT show, I have a few, a little too long at times and often repeats items covered in All About Android and TWIT, still on the listen list for now.All About Android&nbsp;Good android show, the App Arena is handy to find some useful app. The addition of Aaron Newcomb as a sometime guest host is a good asset to the show. Suffers by being too long at times.This week in Tech&nbsp;The original and the classic from the TWIT network, nothing if not funny to hear a bunch or journos thinking they are geeks, definitely consumer IT, news and entertainment.Packet Pushers&nbsp;Serious Network geekery, I think if I here another show on SDN I'll scream. I regularly skip shows but like to keep an eye , or ear , on whats passing through here, and yes sometime too much networking can be enough.FreakonomicsThe hidden side of everything, first of my non tech shows. Great generally interesting topics and a nice consumable length for my morning commute.Planet MoneySimilar vain to Freakonomics, good length and some quality general interest topics.Friday Night Comedy from BBC Radio 430 minutes of humorous British news, get it and have a laugh out load on your commute.On the out&nbsp;Tech News TodayJust didn't make it back on to the list mostly I just couldn't commit to listen daily even with the new format sticking to a better shorter show, add to this one of the hosts with and annoying voice I guess I'll consume my news more weekly.MacBreak WeeklyLove hate relationship, mostly there just isn't enough mac news each week for the length of this show they tend to rabbit on a bit and cover a bunch of other stuff from other shows on the TWIT network. Now is some could just do the section on the picks of the week that would be niceLinux OutlawsThe constant bitching about how bad everything and everyone else has lead this to the drop list.

<p>If you haven’t used <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> then go check it out. It’s certainly come a long way since the early days and expanded beyond just <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. Targeted early at developers its certainly a tool that has different uses to different folk, as a system admin I find it handy to test and build SOE’s, deployment scripts and an assortment of sandbox stuff.</p>

<p>There are countless base box’s available on line if your are not inclined/interested in building your own. There is however not a lot of Solaris base boxes about , mostly I’d guess due to distribution restrictions, or lack of demand. I’ve experimented with <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opscode/bento">bento</a> but <a href="http://www.packer.io/">packer</a> the new kid on the block seems to fit the bill. Since there is no shortage of info on building Linux base boxes I decided if I was going to kick the tires on packer then I’d make it useful and build a Solaris 11 base box.</p>

<p>What you’ll need, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> or VMware Fusion (Workstation) , <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/downloads/index.html">Solaris 11.1 image</a> , I went for the text base installer just because I like to make my life a little more difficult, and <a href="http://www.packer.io/">Packer</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> json config file contains three main parts; builders, provisioners, and post-processors the latter two are optional but used often.</p>

<h4 id="the-builder">The builder</h4>

<p>Most obviously this is where the heavy lifting is done. This contains mostly information about what we are building, guest type weather we have VirtualBox or VMware or other , how big the machine is, user name’s password etc etc. Note line 10 iso_url refers to a local file location I have download the ISO image too since I can’t have a direct URL to the Oracle site.</p>

<p>For our Solaris machine the boot command is a little more complex than the average Linux build hence in the above example “boot command goes here”. The boot command for Linux is usually just a simple boot and use this kickstart file served from packer’s build in http server. The Solaris 11 equivalent would be the boot and use the AI server, well no surprises <a href="http://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> has no built in AI server.</p>

<p>The boot command for our Solaris example contains all the key strokes required to be sent to the virtual-box console to install and reboot the OS. Note there is no key buffer in the console so the strategically placed wait statements are important. With the vnc connection used in VMware this is a little less important.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6219d41bcc08c3e266c0.js"> </script>

<p>As root is a role in Solaris 11 you can’t login as root , so it is important to ensure the vagrant account can sudo to root without password so our post provisioning can finish hence lines 42-47.</p>

<h4 id="the-provisioner">The provisioner</h4>

<p>Simply put this is where we do some stuff to the machine before we turn it into a base box file. Very simple in this case it is running some shell scripts. One to install the required VirtualBox tools the other some minor adjustments to the build, most notable are to place the standard Vagrant ssh keys into the vagrant user account.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6e6fcb7da5c01f03a1c2.js"> </script>

<h4 id="the-wrap-up">The wrap up</h4>
<p>Once your config file is all done it’s a matter of telling packer to go build it, and go and have a coffee or two.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">packer build -only=virtualbox-iso solaris11.json
</code></pre>
<p>So while I can’t share you the resulting base box I can share you the code on how to build your own. Get the <a href="https://github.com/bigal/solaris-packer">files used from github </a>and enjoy, if there are any fixes just submit them to github. Just a point to remember the wait statements timing worked for me on my moderately busy moderately spec’d Mac Mini, hopefully they will work for you but they made need adjusting.</p>]]></content><author><name>Alan Chalmers</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="virtualbox" /><category term="vagrant" /><category term="Solaris 11" /><category term="solaris" /><category term="virtualbox" /><category term="vagrant" /><category term="Solaris 11" /><category term="solaris" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t used Vagrant then go check it out.
