Just need to add flexget to cron and make sure transmission-deamon starts at  system bootup. Ok SMF script needed, being an inherently lazy unix guy , I'll just google that and  and yes number one with the bullet I find <a href="http://www.4amlunch.net/SMF/transmission-daemon/">this</a> over on 4amlunch.net thanks to wonko. A  quick mod on the <span style="font-family:courier new;">TRANSMISSION_HOME</span> to suit my local setup and and transmission-daemon is running from SMF. flexget cronjob added all should be good to go. I'll wait an hour let the cron job run it's course and see what we get.
