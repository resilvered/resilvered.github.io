<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
While the holiday has been over for almost a week already for me after 6 long days at LISA 10 Conference, today we head home.<div><br /></div><div>First off we have a drive down to LA about 5-6 hours depending on the traffic. The weather is as good as when we arrived with a top in LA of 27 and 23 here in San Jose.</div><div><br /></div><div>We have yet to right any postcards, so we might have to squeeze that in before we fly out.</div>
