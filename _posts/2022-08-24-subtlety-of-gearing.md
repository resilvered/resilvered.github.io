For some time now I have been running an 11-36T rear cassette on my road bike. That's right 36T, not that common.
Specific if you are interested it's this [Zitto cassete](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32988907056.html)

Reason being I was after a little additional help on the hills. I'm a big bloke as a Doctor once told me I'm not built for running marathons. Iâ€™m more the front row of you local Rugby team

I run a pretty standard 34/50 compact crank This gives me a gear ratios in the table below with a handy 1:1 ratio at the bottom.

## 11-34 Cassette

|Cog / Chainring|11    |13    |15    |17    |19    |21    |23    |25    |27    |30    |34    |
|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|

A change to 11-36 resulted in a different set of ratios.

I have been running this for some time (~8000kms). My only query was I felt I was in 36 Cog earlier than I should be on the steep climbs and until I looked hard at the numbers in the table. I would have told you the second last cog was the issue. However looking at the numbers I'm not sure it was.

Enter the Sub Compact crank. I'm now running a [Praxis Alba](https://praxiscycles.com/) 32/48 crank, second hand on Ebay for a little over $100. At the same time I have change back to the the 11-34T cassette that has had very little wear (~1000km)

|32             |2.9091|2.4615|2.1333|1.8824|1.6842|1.5238|1.3913|1.2800|1.1852|1.0667|0.9412|

Now the feel on the bike is like I am not going into the 34 Cog as often as the I was the 36 Cog in fact the 34 is typical now only for the extra pinches >9%.
What the maths shows is that in the <1.2 ratio I have 4 gears in that range to play whereas both the 34T and 36T on the compact chainring I only have 3 gears.

The difference is very subtle and honestly on paper it really does not look a whole lot different. On the bike however I now feel I have better options at the lower end of the gear selection.

Now the obvious thing is I have lost some top end speed. I'm topping out at around 53Km/hr as opposed to what would maybe have been 54-55Km/hr. Now if I was doing fast bunch rides mostly on the flat this may be an issue. But I'm no. A flat ride for me has at least 300meters of climbing in it and I'm riding solo, not in any condition to be doing sustained 55Km/hr on my own.

So give it try don;t be afraid to look outside the standard setups There is a pretty good article on [Cycling tips](https://cyclingtips.com/2016/11/sub-compact-and-the-future-of-wide-range-road-bike-gearing/) from 2016 that talks about this.
