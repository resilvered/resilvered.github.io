<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<a href="http://www.ergfit.com.au">Ergfit</a> boot camp started today. It's not the first boot camp I have done so I kinda know what I've signed up for , I think, different crew so it will know doubt have different challenges.<div><br /></div><div>So Sunday start was essentially tests and measure, gauging the start to see where you finish. I tipped the scales at 105.4Kg which was a little more than expected as in recent months I have been around 98-99Kg. The testing finished with 2.3Km run that had a nasty little hill climb at the end 11:40 was my time. I'm sure Michelle, one of the trainers, was worried I was going to require mouth to mouth the way I was trying to suck in the oxygen at the end.</div><div><br /></div><div>There some focus on setting goals at this boot camp and those that know me will be aware I'm not really a goal setter, perhaps why i'll never achieve greatness :-) Although I have made it a goal over last 18-24 months to improve my fitness and not be held back back previous inquires. It's taken a fair amount of commitment and not inconsiderable amount of sweat thus far, so the real goal now is to kick on and take that to the next level.</div><div><br /></div><div>over for now </div>
