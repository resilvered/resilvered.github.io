<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
A quick run down on events for today, more to follow, maybe.<div><br /></div><div>First stop Cowgirl Creamery in Petaluma, turned out just to be the office, oops.</div><div><br /></div><div>Second stop <a href="http://www.twit.tv/">The Twit Cottage</a>, a geek's indigence, I listen to some podcasts from these guys. Had a brief chat with Alex Lindsay outside the cottage and he suggested we might have better luck with the Cowgirl Creamery in Point Reyes, lucky we were heading that way.</div><div><br /></div><div>Stop three, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/historyculture/people_maritime_lighthouse.htm">Point Reyes Lighthouse</a>, here is a tip , don't go there on a bad weather day, apparently only the second foggiest place in North America. We had a good weather day and there was limited visibility, oh and take a jacket, or jumper, and be prepared for a 30 storey climb back up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Stop Four,  lunch at Station House Cafe at Point Reyes, followed by a visit to the <a href="http://www.cowgirlcreamery.com/">Cowgirl Creamery</a> nice cheese.</div><div><br /></div><div>Last stop for the day was the small town of Graton just west of Santa Rosa for an afternoon beverage.</div><div><br /></div>
