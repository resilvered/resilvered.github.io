First day since we arrived that we haven't driven anywhere. Had  a sleep in before we took a walk around Santa Rosa , spent a few hours wondering about made a couple of purchases and generally had a relaxing day. Took a scenic drive to Wholefoods supermarket to pick up some items to cook for diner. Managed to squeeze in a quick run to keep up with my bootcamp training while I am away and planed out the day for tomorrow.<div><br /></div><div>Tomorrow looks like this , so hopefully some more interesting things for everyone tomorrow.<br /><div><br /></div><div> </div><br /><br /><iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=107135490349484998297.0004941d69bc3ecd4427c&amp;ll=38.419166,-122.505798&amp;spn=0.376584,0.583649&amp;z=10&amp;output=embed"></iframe><br /><small>View <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=107135490349484998297.0004941d69bc3ecd4427c&amp;ll=38.419166,-122.505798&amp;spn=0.376584,0.583649&amp;z=10&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">Dy's place</a> in a larger map</small></div>
