The stats read<div><br /></div><div>weight 104.4 Kg </div><div>max power split 1:22</div><div>100 meter time 17.5 sec</div><div>500 meter time 1:33.2</div><div>20 min row 4974 M 2:00.6 split</div><div><br /></div><div>Heres the tip don't eat too much before work out. I'm not use to a late workout (7pm) and I was trying to figure out how I would do it. Got it wrong this time and as a result I was pretty disappointed with my 20 minute row I should have comfortably been able to do a sub 2 minute split instead I really struggled to do what I did.</div><div><br /></div><div>We didn't do the 500 Meter piece until this morning and 1:33.2 is a PB so the morning must suite me.  Need to do the food diary for today.</div>
