I&nbsp;stopped&nbsp;using CIFS at home sometime ago it was often painful and had some odd side effects with ACLs on my ZFS file server that I honestly just can't be bothered trying to figure out.<br /><br />So I have a Windows 7VM that i need to use for some occasional work and today is one of those days. I need an iso image of my file server and Microsoft has finally seen fit to included a NS client, so time to give it a spin.<br /><br />First up you need to install NFS services, so&nbsp;that would be&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Control Panel-&gt;Programs-&gt;Programs and Features-&gt; Turn Windows feature on or off</span>&nbsp;and find Services for NFS and check those boxes<br /><br />Drop to a DOS cmd&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;and while the mount command doesn't&nbsp;support&nbsp;the standard UNIX command syntax, that would be too easy, but it does work like this<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">mount -u:username \\server\share Z:</span><br /><br />Your in&nbsp;business&nbsp;now and I don't need to add SMB shares to my fileserver<br /><br /><br />
