Second attempt as to record some thoughts down.  Lets kick if off.<br /><br />Not into big Media then check out <a href="http://bumrushthecharts.blogspot.com/">Bum Rush The Charts</a>  the podcasting and indie media attempt to influence the Music charts. Worth a look plus Black Lab has some pretty good stuff.<br /><br />Speaking of podcasting... can't actually recall the last time I listened to mainstream radio..
