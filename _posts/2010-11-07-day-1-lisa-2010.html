Wet day in San Jose, not to matter will be inside all day. Doing the S1 VMware vSphere training session, a good introduction and much needed clarification on on some of the names of products that keep changing, apparently it's also confusing inside VMware so no wonder we can't understand it.<div><br /></div><div>Appears to be the possibility the the vCenter server and the vSphere fat client may become available on something other than Windows OS</div>
