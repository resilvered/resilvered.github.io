<h1>Installing Ruby 1.9.3 and libyaml on Solaris 11</h1></br>Recent blog entries would indicate I've upgrade to Solaris 11 proper or Solaris 11/11 as it goes by.  The upgrade was mostly driven by the fact I need to compile some software and figured I may as well have the most recent version rather than on the express edition. I'm looking into <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> at the moment as it might fit in with some of the automation bits I'm playing with. I'm not getting into <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>  here just yet as there are a couple of steps I need to do to first to prep my Solaris 11 environment.</br></br>For the "First cloud OS" Solaris 11 is distinctly lacking some items that you could almost say are essentials in todays cloud, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>.  And I here the cries from the Oracle faithful we ship <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, Hmm Version 1.8 nearly 5 years old and only months away from EOL.  I did attempt to install <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> with version 1.8 and gem just failed to meet the prerequisites by 0.0.1 if I recall. None the less I had committed to building a more recent version of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> that I'll need for some other stuff in progress.</br></br>So what do you need to build ruby 1.9.3-p125 on Solaris 11,a compiler obviously and I'm using the gcc 4.5.2 include in the Solaris 11 repo, and <a href="http://pyyaml.org">libyaml</a>, otherwise we end by with this annoying message.</br></br><pre>It seems your ruby installation is missing psych (for YAML output). To eliminate this warning, please install libyaml and reinstall your ruby.</pre></br><h2>Installing libyaml</h2>While vagrant didn't seem to need this I'm not big on annoying messages and who's know when I'll need it. <pre><br />wget http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.1.4.tar.gz<br />tar xzf yaml-0.1.4.tar.gz<br />cd yaml-0.1.4<br />./configure<br />make<br />sudo make install<br /></pre></br>Pretty straight forward no issues. </br><h2>Installing Ruby 1.9.3-p125</h2><pre><br />wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.3-p125.tar.gz<br />tar xzf ruby-1.9.3-p125.tar.gz<br />cd ruby-1.9.3-p125<br />./configure --enable-shared --with-opt-dir=/usr/local/lib  <br />make<br />sudo make install<br /></pre></br>Worth noting <a href="http://pyyaml.org">libyaml</a> couldn't be found without specifying <i>---with-opt-dir</i></br><pre><br />ruby -v<br />ruby 1.9.3p125 (2012-02-16) [i386-solaris2.11]<br />gem -v <br />1.8.11<br /></pre></br>I'm not altogether happy doing the make installs I'd like to serve these packages up via IPS. I think for that I need a proper build server environment, an IPS repo, and probably some tools to help me package that all up, sounds like an ideal use for a zone. For now it will need wait til I have some more time on my hands.
