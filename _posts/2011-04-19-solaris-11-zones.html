    Nice video.  I have just installed a Solaris 11 sandbox.  I have a Solaris 11 container, which was easy, but getting a Solaris 10 container is what I am trying to do next, so finding this video has been great.  You&#39;d think Oracle would have this documented quite visibly, but oddly it is not.<br /><br />I am stuck on the part of the zoneadm -z brown install<br /><br />How do I get the Solaris 10 ISO image to be read by the zoneadm install?<br /><br />In my case, the zone is called tz-sol10 BUT my publisher command shows localhost<br /><br />The path to this is actually /var/pkg/download
